    <h2>Destructure of Arrays and Objects in JS</h2>

    <p>Object is not iterable. 
        It will resukt to uncaught error, that it is an object</p>

        <p>arrays are iterable</p>

    <p>a for of loop can be run on arrays to loop over objects.

        For this to happen, you have to know three object built-in methods
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Object.keys: recieves object as its parameters</li>
        <li>Object.values:</li>
        <li>Object.entries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        can loop over arrays using the for of loop.  You also learned that you can extract object's keys, values, 
        or both, using the Object.keys(), Object.values() and Object.entries() syntax.

    </p>
